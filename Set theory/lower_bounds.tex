\[\text{Let } x \in \mathbb{R} \text{ so that } x > 0.\text{ Then } \floor*{\sqrt{x}} = \floor*{\sqrt{\floor*{x}}}. \]

\begin{proof}

Let us suppose for a contradiction that the proposition is not true. In other words $x \in \mathbb{R} > 0$ and

\[ \floor*{\sqrt{x}} \neq \floor*{\sqrt{\floor*{x}}} \] 

Consider that this really holds if and only if

\[ | \sqrt{x} - \sqrt{\floor*{x}} | \geq 1 \]

because, intuitively, if the difference between the two numbers was lower than 1, flooring them would \emph{cancel it out}. However, from this automatically follows that the inequality will surely hold also for their squares: after multiplying the inequality with $| \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{\floor*{x}} |$ we get

\[ | x - \floor*{x} | \geq | \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{\floor*{x}} | \]

and since $| \sqrt{x} - \sqrt{\floor*{x}} | \geq 1$, clearly $| \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{\floor*{x}} | \geq 1$. Thus

\[ | x - \floor*{x} | \geq 1 \]

which is a contradiction with the definition of $\floor*{x}$.


\end{proof}
